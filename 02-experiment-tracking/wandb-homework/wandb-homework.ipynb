    "\n",
    "The goal of this homework is to get familiar with Weights & Biases for experiment tracking, model management, hyperparameter optimization, and many more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before getting started with the homework, you need to have a Weights & Biases account. You can do so by visiting wandb.ai/site and clicking on the Sign Up button.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q1. Install the Package\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started with Weights & Biases you'll need to install the appropriate Python package.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this we recommend creating a separate Python environment, for example, you can use conda environments, and then install the package there with pip or conda.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following are the libraries you need to install:\n",
    "\n",
    "* pandas\n",
    "* matplotlib\n",
    "* scikit-learn\n",
    "* pyarrow\n",
    "* wandb\n",

    "Once you installed the package, run the command wandb --version and check the output."
